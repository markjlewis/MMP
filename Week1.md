# Week 1

This first week has mainly involved research into the project as we haven't yet had a meeting with the marketing department to discuss 
requirements.

I have been looking at prospectus apps that other univeristies are using so I can take some ideas to the meeting with marketing. It seems
that most Uni's either use an app which directly displays a PDF of their prospectus from within the app with web links to areas of 
departmental websites or the app displays a "news feed" of news items with meta tags for different departments.

I have also been looking at some potential designs but I need to know more about the apps functionality before I can finalise any 
designs.

The other thing I have been looking at this week is the android APK. I have been playing around with layouts and XML as well as looking
at any other libraries which may be useful once I have requirements to work with.
