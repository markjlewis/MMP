# Weeks 5 and 6

The previous 2 weeks have continued on from previous weeks of setting up pages of the app and pulling the content from the web. The app 
now has all the pages I originally planned to implement, including the content from the website for each page. This should now for a basis
for the rest of the app.

This leaves me to improve the layout of the apps content/pages as well as storing data for offline use.
