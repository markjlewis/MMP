# Week 10 

This week i have been focusing on writing my report, which has taken up almost all of my time. I am currently 13000 words in.

I have  found a bug whilst testing the app on tablets. It crashes on start up due to the way the app checks whether there is internet
connection. As well as working on my report i will be trying to fix this issue in the comming week.
