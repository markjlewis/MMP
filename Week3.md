Week 3
#
This week I have been working on pulling data from the courses.aber.ac.uk website to be displayed on the app. To do this I have been using
a library called JSoup (jsoup.org).

I currently have a prototype app which pulls all courses from each department and displays them in a list view. The courses can then be 
clicked on to display more information. Currently I am just pulling the raw html for each section (overview, content, employability, teaching,
student views) and letting androids web view display the content. But in the future I will probably try and incorperate a CSS.

The app hasn't yet adopted any UI design as I first want to get the functionality working without wasting time on a design which may not be
suitable for the design.
