# Week 7

This week I have been working on offline storage of the data now that I have got all the content for the app. So far I have saved the content
of a handful of the apps pages; Study Abroad, Students Union, Sports & Societies, Open Days, Virtual Open Days and some content on the 
Scholarships page.

The pages listed above read in the data as strings and therefore can all share the same read/write method.

I will be working on saving data stored as an arraylist this week and also the areas of the app where the structure is more complicated 
such as undergrad/postgrad courses.
