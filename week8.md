# Week 8
At the start of this week I continued with the storage of data on the device. I have no wrote a class which pulls all the data needed on
to the device using Jsoup. Rather than storing just the arrays required I chose to store the whole page, this means if content changes
then the whole page will be saved and can be used.

I have also created a new menu page for the app. Initally I looked at using a swipe menu which is very popular on android devices. But I 
am no longer using this as I don't think the content fits the design. Therefore I have used a page which contains buttons to other areas 
of the app.

Another feature I have implemented this week was to check for data/internet connection on the apps start up. If there is no data 
on the phone the app will attempt to download the data and show a "splash" style screen. If there is no data and connection then it 
displays a message to ask the user to establish a connection and restart the app. If there is data on the device it loads up the menu page.

I have also been improving the design of pages on the app to give it a more professional feel.
