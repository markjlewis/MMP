Week 2
#

This week I have focused mainly on the design of the app. As I am still unsure what is going to be in the app I have created designs 
which can be used to display content. I have created two designs, one using drop downs and another using tabs. These designs are seperate
files on this branch.

I created the designs using a web tool called FludiUi(https://www.fluidui.com/). The tool is quiet limited as it is free to use, but you 
pay for me features. But all in all it is an easy way of making mockups of the app.

Along with creating mockups I have also had a look at a couple of design libraries which could give the app a more professional feel. I 
have found a few potential libraries on Android Arsenal.

The other area I have focused on this week is implementing a chat client. This could be a potential requirement if the marketing department
want to base the app around the Uni's virtual open days. So far I have looked at a couple of tutorials using Smack, a library for XMPP on 
android. Many of the tutorials are for older versions of Android and the APK and I have therefore struggled to get them to work.
