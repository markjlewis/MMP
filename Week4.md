This week has been the slower than the previous three, mainly because I have been trying out new ways of working towards implementing
requirements. Since the meeting with Angharad from the marketing team last tuesday I have been trying to finalise the requirements. I have
been doing this by researching other Uni's apps, in total I have looked at about 10 apps all from british universities. These 10 apps are
all that I have been able to find which also target prospective students, compared to open day/current student apps which are more popular
on the app store.

I have created a start page with a navigation bar(swipe menu) to be the main activity of the app and have integrated the course finder I 
previously made. Hopefully I should now be able use this as a building block to integrate further features. I have also populated the menu 
with the titles for pages I think may be relevent, but I need to run this past marketing first.

Another thing I have been working on this week is adding the university's house style to the app. I have added colours taken from the 
website as I am still waiting to hear back from marketing on the offical colour codes.
