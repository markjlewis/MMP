# Week 9

This week has involved finishing off the app. All functionality is now in place except for an option for downloading the latest version 
of the data. This is something I plan to implement in the coming week.

I have spent the rest of my time improving the UI, changin font styles/colours and moving elements around the screen to improve the layout. 
These tasks take time as the app has to be re-built each time you want to view any changes and often it takes multiple attempts to get the 
desired layouts.

Finnally i have started work on my report. I have drafted the first section on background work, analysis and processes and have also started
the design section of the document.
